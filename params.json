Thesis at Budapest University of Technology and Economics, by me Tam√°s Nagy.\r\n\r\nMain scope being to develop the Common Java API which supports connecting to Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive clouds.\r\n\r\nAs part of my thesis I developed a sample desktop application which gives an example on how the different cloud providers storage can be used in an application, without making difference between them, using the common API.\r\n\r\nProject uses Gradle as building tool. At descriptions I provide build commands which can be executed from terminal.\r\n\r\n## Parts of the project\r\n\r\n### Common Java API\r\nCheck the Readme file of the API [here](/cluedrive-api/README.md)\r\n\r\n### Sample Application a.k.a ClueDrive Application.\r\nIf you are interested in applications Readme file read [this](cluedrive-application/README.md)\r\nYou can find the applications help by clicking [here](http://tamsnagy.github.io/ClueDrive/help.html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
