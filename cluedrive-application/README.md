#ClueDrive Application

## Description
Using this desktop application you will be able, to handle your clouds on a unified surface.

You just need to authorize this app at your cloud provider to access your files. Than you will be able to list, upload and download your files up to 100 MB. Create new folders, delete folders.

If you would like to try out the application and don't want to bother with compile and application setup at cloud providers, than send me an email an I will provide you a runnable jar :)
