# ClueDrive
Common Java API for storage cloud services

This project was created as Bsc. Thesis at Budapest University of Technology and Economics, by me Tamás Nagy.

Main scope being to develop the Common Java API which supports connecting to Dropbox, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive clouds.

As part of my thesis I developed a sample desktop application which gives an example on how the different cloud providers storage can be used in an application, without making difference between them, using the common API.
